# Death Of The Salesman — Complete Development PR Plan

**Version 1 · 2026-10-18T16:53:39Z · 160 verified-for-planning work units across 13 phases.** Planned ≠ implemented. GitHub remains the authority for PR merges, CI and deployed release evidence. Roadmap IDs are immutable. The PR count is calculated from `registry/prs.json`, not guessed from GitHub ordinal PR numbers.

**Canonical plan:** [`registry/prs.json`](../registry/prs.json) using Boardroom's shared PR registry schema v1. This Markdown renders that same canonical unit set and must remain synchronized by validator. Read [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), [`TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`](TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md), and [`PRODUCT_INTERACTION_DESIGN.md`](PRODUCT_INTERACTION_DESIGN.md) before implementing a unit.

## Product rules that every PR must preserve

- Standalone **API-native** commercial sales and lawful fundraising suite; no hybrid ChatGPT scheduled-task integration. Models run as bounded API/inference jobs, not permanent minds.
- The owner's first two names are **Fast Eddie Felson** and **Harry Wormwood**; all 264 provided names remain reserved in `registry/approved-salesman-names.json`. Commercial tenants start empty. Original/rights-cleared avatars only.
- Desktop should match the approved dark, avatar-rich bucket board closely, but adapt to tablets and phones. **No random salesman quote in any screen.**
- Configurable champion vs experimental strategy ratio (proposed 50/50) and independent six-model routing, with real evidence and separate tests of model and strategy effects.
- **All paid model, GPU, data, email and infrastructure spending is disabled at $0 by default.** Real sends, grants, regulated investor representations, contractual commitments and cash movements require explicit owner authorization and policy gates.
- Security/privacy by default; deterministic checks after model output, per-lead ownership, universal opt-out, evidence-based statistics, no claims of verified outcomes from unverified model narratives.
- Treat the architecture as a specification. It is not proof the application is working. Unit acceptance is not the same as production operational acceptance.

## Recommended implementation order and release gates

**Gate G0 — architecture ready (merged #1):** design, agent roster and provider candidates merged. **Gate G1 — zero-cost clickable console (F1–F2):** owner can create projects, view agents, assign Fast Eddie and Harry to buckets, observe truthful demo/idle status and inspect cards, all offline. **Gate G2 — $0 agent simulation (F3–F4):** budget control, durable workers, approvals, audited proposals and fake tools demonstrated without keys. **Gate G3 — model-enabled drafting (F5 + selected F6/F7):** six provider implementations pass mocks, actual calls only with owner-provisioned keys and caps, and drafts grounded in approved product facts. **Gate G4 — consent- and approval-controlled sales pilot (F6–F8 + F12 live gate):** mail domain and opt-out verified, one bounded live test; don't infer go-live from merged code. **Gate G5 — optimization and funding (F9–F10):** strategy results, grant workflow, investor relations and funding receipts validated. **Gate G6 — full revenue operations and commercial readiness (F11–F12):** payment acceptance, privacy, recovery, scale and tenants tested where relevant.

**Scheduling:** Phase order establishes a preferred delivery sequence, not a global serial lock. An eligible unit can execute as soon as its explicit `dependsOn` dependencies are completed and all external prerequisites are met. Parallel work should use non-overlapping files/resources. Prioritize G1 and G2 under the current $0 constraint. Never block all work solely because a live-provider or infrastructure prerequisite is missing.

**PR discipline:** Each work unit is a proposed reviewable PR or independently verifiable PR-sized increment. Begin future PR titles with its `DOTS-NNN` ID. A unit may have multiple real follow-up PRs; update explicit `prs` only after GitHub creates each PR. Do not invent PR numbers, merge checks or status. A merged PR is source-accepted, but a feature can remain unverified until functional/live acceptance. Tests must run locally/CI against synthetic data and mocked APIs with no paid calls; opt-in real integrations are marked as external prerequisites.

**Milestone blocks and external requirements:**  `liveadapter`, `liveemail`, `infra`, `prod`, `realcanary`, `merchantcanary`, `commercial`, and `integrations` are conditional on specific credentials, spending, regulation, or cross-repository approvals as shown in their units. These dependencies do NOT authorize a spend or real outreach.

## Project acceptance / required evidence

1. **Engineering:** per-unit lint, strict typecheck, unit/property tests, migration tests, API contract tests, system CI and reproducible build. Dependency changes audited and pinned. No flaky test suppression as proof.
2. **End-to-end:** screenshot and keyboard/touch testing at 1440, 1024, 768, 390 and 320 pixels; agent drag/drop and alternative input; project/agent/strategy/campaign/budget/conversation/funding flows.
3. **Security:** zero-budget hard stops, actual send-side checks, tenant RLS, OAuth/webhook verification, consent/opt-out before dispatch, prompt-injection and SSRF protection, encrypted backups, secret scanning, owner action scope.
4. **Observability:** real heartbeat and lease for green; yellow reason visible; red inactive; exact timestamp and evidence for each activity, contact event, invoice, spend and funding receipt.
5. **Provider evaluation:** all six adapter conformance suites with stubs at $0; live smoke requires real credential and owner-approved positive budget, and verified receipts. Open-weight weights are external artifacts, not Git content.
6. **Go-live:** documented resource costs, staged migration and backup/restore, test mailbox and safe sender, unsubscribe processing, actual deployed SHA, verified real transaction only when owner approves, manual pause/kill drill.
7. **Non-goals:** Vision Agents; covert/deceptive high-volume outreach; unauthorized political persuasion, paid spend or investment offers; self-reproducing agents with unrestricted tool access; assuming a model callback is itself evidence of revenue or funding.

## Roadmap maintenance and GitHub truth

Only `registry/prs.json` is the machine-readable authority; `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` is a derived readable projection. An empty `prs` array means **planned but no exact PR yet**, not failed work. `pullRequests` records are only dated observations; current GitHub PR metadata determines merged/open/closed state. `plannedPrCount` must equal the number of `units`. IDs and historical PR associations must be preserved when new work is added. External dependencies can never be used to assert that another repo has shipped code without authoritative confirmation.

Validation command: `node scripts/validate-pr-registry.mjs` (and the roadmap CI job). If scope changes, update the registry, regenerate the readable document and increment `roadmapVersion`. New units require an explicit source and dependencies. Work completed outside this repository must be tracked in the owning repo.

The release dashboard must distinguish: **planned work**, **PR submitted**, **PR merged**, **integration verified**, **deployed**, and **live campaign operating**. No single count substitutes for those statuses.
